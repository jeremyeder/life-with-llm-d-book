# Persona Validation Framework

This framework validates book content against target reader personas to ensure the content meets specific user needs and expectations.

## Overview

The persona validation framework analyzes chapter content across multiple dimensions:
- **Relevance**: How well the content addresses persona-specific needs
- **Complexity**: Whether the technical depth is appropriate for the persona's experience level
- **Completeness**: Whether the content provides sufficient information for the persona's goals

## Available Personas

### Alex Chen - Early Career Platform Engineer
- **Experience**: 2-3 years platform engineering
- **Goal**: Evaluate llm-d for Model-as-a-Service implementation
- **Focus**: Quick setup, clear procedures, business justification
- **Pain Points**: Limited evaluation time, need to justify decisions

### Morgan Rodriguez - Mid-Career ML Engineer  
- **Experience**: 5-7 years ML engineering
- **Goal**: Optimize inference performance for production workloads
- **Focus**: Advanced configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting
- **Pain Points**: Has been burned by immature platforms, needs reliability

## Usage

### Basic Validation
```bash
# Validate single chapter against specific persona
./scripts/validate-personas.sh docs/02-installation-setup.md alex-platform-engineer

# Validate against all personas
./scripts/validate-personas.sh docs/05-sre-operations.md

# JSON output for tooling integration
./scripts/validate-personas.sh docs/11-cost-optimization.md morgan-ml-engineer --format json
```

### Comprehensive Reporting
```bash
# Generate full report for all chapters and personas
python3 scripts/generate-persona-report.py

# Generate report for specific personas
python3 scripts/generate-persona-report.py --personas alex-platform-engineer

# Output to file
python3 scripts/generate-persona-report.py --output persona-report.txt
```

### Complexity Analysis
```bash
# Analyze technical complexity
python3 scripts/complexity-analyzer.py --file docs/06-performance-optimization.md

# Evaluate for specific persona level
python3 scripts/complexity-analyzer.py --file docs/08-troubleshooting.md --persona-level intermediate
```

## Scoring System

### Relevance Score (1-5)
- **5**: Essential for persona success
- **4**: Highly valuable, significantly helpful
- **3**: Moderately useful, nice to have
- **2**: Somewhat relevant, could be helpful
- **1**: Not relevant to persona needs

### Complexity Score (1-5)
- **5**: Perfect complexity level for persona expertise
- **4**: Slightly challenging but manageable
- **3**: Appropriate with some learning curve
- **2**: Too complex or too simple
- **1**: Completely inappropriate complexity level

## Integration with Validation Framework

The persona validation is integrated into the main validation suite:

```bash
# Run all validations including persona validation
./scripts/run-all-validations.sh
```

This generates a comprehensive persona validation report as part of the standard validation process.

## Customization

### Adding New Personas
1. Create new YAML file in `scripts/personas/`
2. Define persona characteristics, goals, and validation criteria
3. Add to `AVAILABLE_PERSONAS` in `validate-personas.sh`
4. Update `generate-persona-report.py` defaults if needed

### Modifying Validation Criteria
Edit the persona YAML files to adjust:
- `chapter_priorities`: Priority levels for each chapter
- `validation_criteria`: Specific requirements for relevance assessment
- `complexity_preferences`: Technical depth expectations

## Example Persona Definition

```yaml
name: "Alex Chen"
role: "Early Career Platform Engineer"
experience_years: "2-3"

goals:
  - "Deliver reliable, scalable inference service within 6 months"
  - "Minimize operational overhead and maintenance burden"

pain_points:
  - "Limited time for deep research"
  - "Pressure to choose proven, well-supported solutions"

validation_criteria:
  relevance_factors:
    - "Quick-start guides that work without extensive customization"
    - "Clear operational requirements and resource specifications"

chapter_priorities:
  "02-installation-setup": 5  # Critical
  "05-sre-operations": 4      # High
  "11-cost-optimization": 4   # High
```

## Output Examples

### Text Report
```
PERSONA VALIDATION REPORT
Chapter: 02-installation-setup
Persona: Alex Chen (Early Career Platform Engineer)

SCORES:
  Relevance: 4/5
  Complexity: 3/5
  Overall: 3.5/5

RECOMMENDATIONS:

  → Include resource planning templates
```

### JSON Report
```json
{
  "chapter": "02-installation-setup",
  "persona": {
    "name": "Alex Chen",
    "role": "Early Career Platform Engineer"
  },
  "scores": {
    "relevance": 4,
    "complexity": 3,
    "overall": 3.5
  },
  "analysis": {
    "recommendations": [
      "Add quick-start section for evaluation",
      "Include resource planning templates"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Performance**: Validation runs in parallel where possible
- **Caching**: Results can be cached for large documentation sets
- **Extensibility**: Framework designed for easy addition of new personas
- **Integration**: Works with existing validation infrastructure
- **Reporting**: Multiple output formats for different use cases
