# Review Summary - Life with llm-d Book

## Review Feedback (Date: Current Session)

### Content Decisions
- ✅ Chapter order is logical (Introduction → Installation → Architecture → DS → SRE → Performance)
- ✅ Technical complexity is "just right"
- ✅ Writing feels professional and human-written
- ✅ Content verbosity is at good detail level
- ✅ Keep basic cost analysis for now

### New Requirements
1. **Code Block Formatting**:
   - Add `showLineNumbers` for copy-paste friendliness
   - Include download links in code block titles
   - Mixed visibility: 1-5 lines visible, 6-30 preview, 30+ collapsed
   - All examples to be stored in `/examples/chapter-XX/` directories

2. **Additional Content TODO**:
   - Security/RBAC chapter needed
   - Cost Optimization chapter needed  
   - MLOps/CI-CD chapter needed
   - 9 additional operational runbooks
   - Performance benchmarks and cost analysis (deferred)

3. **Infrastructure TODO**:
   - Build test harness CI suite for code validation
   - Add automatic changelog generation
   - Extract all code examples to examples directory

### Next Chapter Priority
1. Performance Optimization
2. Security and Compliance
3. Troubleshooting Guide
4. Reference/Appendix sections

### Quality Metrics
- 5 chapters complete (4,174 lines)
- 0 linting errors
