## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Diagnostic Assessment

Start with a comprehensive health check:

```bash
# Check overall system health
./diagnostic-tools/llm-d-health-check.sh <namespace> <deployment>

# Collect detailed diagnostics
python ./diagnostic-tools/collect-diagnostics.py <namespace> <deployment>

# Profile GPU memory usage (run inside pod)
python ./diagnostic-tools/gpu-memory-profile.py
```

### 2. Performance Analysis

For performance issues:

```bash
# Run load test
python ./performance-troubleshooting/load-test.py

# Optimize GPU memory
python ./performance-troubleshooting/gpu-memory-optimizer.py

# Profile inference performance
python ./performance-troubleshooting/inference-optimizer.py
```

### 3. Emergency Response

For critical incidents:

```bash
# P0 Service Outage
./emergency-procedures/P0-service-outage.sh

# GPU Cluster Failure
./emergency-procedures/gpu-cluster-failure.sh

# Memory Pressure
./emergency-procedures/memory-pressure.sh
```

### 4. Standard Procedures

Follow SOPs for consistent response:

```bash
# Service outage response
./standard-operating-procedures/SOP-001-service-outage-response.sh

# Memory issues
./standard-operating-procedures/SOP-002-high-memory-usage-response.sh

# GPU problems
./standard-operating-procedures/SOP-003-gpu-not-available-response.sh
```

## Usage Patterns

### Incident Response Workflow

1. **Detection** ‚Üí Run diagnostic tools
2. **Assessment** ‚Üí Use performance analysis
3. **Response** ‚Üí Execute emergency procedures
4. **Resolution** ‚Üí Follow standard procedures
5. **Recovery** ‚Üí Verify with diagnostic tools

### Performance Optimization Workflow

1. **Baseline** ‚Üí Establish performance metrics
2. **Profile** ‚Üí Identify bottlenecks
3. **Optimize** ‚Üí Apply performance improvements
4. **Test** ‚Üí Validate with load testing
5. **Monitor** ‚Üí Continuous performance tracking

## Best Practices

### üéØ Diagnostic Best Practices
- Always collect diagnostics before making changes
- Save diagnostic outputs for post-incident analysis
- Use structured logging for better analysis
- Monitor trends, not just point-in-time metrics

### ‚ö° Performance Best Practices
- Start with quick wins (quantization, batching)
- Profile before optimizing
- Test changes in non-production first
- Monitor impact of optimizations

### üö® Emergency Best Practices
- Follow escalation procedures
- Document all actions taken
- Communicate status regularly
- Preserve evidence for post-incident review

### üìã Operational Best Practices
- Regular SOP training and drills
- Keep procedures updated
- Use automation where possible
- Learn from each incident

## Customization

### Adapting Scripts
Most scripts can be customized by:
- Modifying environment variables
- Adjusting thresholds and limits
- Adding organization-specific logic
- Integrating with existing tools

### Adding New Tools
When adding new troubleshooting tools:
1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Include comprehensive header documentation
3. Add usage examples
4. Update this README
5. Test thoroughly in non-production

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Review and update scripts quarterly
- Validate against new llm-d versions
- Incorporate lessons learned from incidents
- Test all procedures regularly

### Documentation
- Keep inline documentation current
