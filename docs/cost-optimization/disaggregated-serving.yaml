# Prefill/Decode Disaggregated Serving Configuration
#
# llm-d's disaggregated serving architecture separates LLM inference into
# two optimized phases: prefill (understanding input) and decode (generating output).
# This provides 30-40% cost reduction with better performance.
#
# Architecture Benefits:
# - Prefill fleet: Optimized for throughput, uses spot instances, larger batches
# - Decode fleet: Optimized for latency, mixed instances, smaller batches
# - Independent scaling based on workload characteristics
# - Better resource utilization across different request types
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl apply -f disaggregated-serving.yaml
#
# See: docs/11-cost-optimization.md#prefill-decode-disaggregation-llm-ds-secret-weapon
