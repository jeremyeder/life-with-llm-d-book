# Cost Optimization

:::info Chapter Overview
This chapter teaches you how to dramatically reduce LLM deployment costs (often by 50-80%) while maintaining quality and performance. We'll cover practical strategies that work for any team size, from startups to enterprises.

**What you'll learn:**

- Why LLM costs are different and how to model them
- Simple techniques that provide immediate 30-50% savings
- Advanced optimizations for deeper cost reductions
- Real case studies showing $1M → $200K transformations
:::

## Why LLM Cost Optimization Matters

### The LLM Cost Challenge

Running large language models is expensive - much more expensive than traditional applications. Here's why:

**Traditional Web App**: $100/month might serve 100,000 users
**LLM Application**: $100/month might serve 1,000 users (100x more expensive!)

This cost difference comes from:

- **Massive compute requirements**: LLMs need powerful GPUs
- **Memory intensive**: Models require 10-100GB+ of fast memory  
- **Always-on nature**: Unlike batch jobs, LLMs serve real-time requests
- **Quality demands**: Users expect fast, accurate responses

### The Good News

With proper optimization, you can achieve dramatic cost reductions:
- **50-70% reduction**: Through quantization and efficient resource use
- **30-40% reduction**: Through disaggregated serving (prefill/decode split)
- **20-30% reduction**: Through intelligent request routing
- **40-60% reduction**: Through spot instances and scheduling

**Combined effect**: 80%+ total cost reduction is achievable!

## Quick Start: Immediate Cost Wins

If you're new to LLM cost optimization, start here! These changes can be implemented in hours and provide immediate savings:

### 1. Enable Quantization (30-50% savings, 1 hour)
```yaml
# Change your LLMDeployment from this:
spec:
  model:
    name: "llama-3.1-8b"
    # No quantization = expensive!

# To this:
spec:
  model:
    name: "llama-3.1-8b"
    quantization:
      type: "int8"  # 50% cost reduction!
```

### 2. Use Spot Instances (40-60% savings, 30 minutes)
```yaml
# Add to your deployment:
nodeSelector:
  instance-type: "spot"
tolerations:
- key: "spot-instance"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

### 3. Enable Autoscaling (20-40% savings, 15 minutes)
```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 1  # Scale down when idle
  maxReplicas: 10 # Scale up when busy
  targetGPUUtilization: 70  # Don't waste resources
```

### 4. Right-size Resources (10-30% savings, 10 minutes)
- Don't request more GPU memory than you need
- Start with smaller instances and scale up if needed
- Monitor actual usage and adjust

**Total potential savings from these 4 changes: 60-80%!**

## Cost Modeling and Budgeting

### Understanding LLM Cost Structure

Before optimizing costs, you need to understand where your money goes. LLM deployments have a very different cost profile than traditional applications:

```mermaid
pie title LLM Infrastructure Cost Breakdown
    "GPU Compute" : 65
    "Storage & I/O" : 15
    "Memory & CPU" : 12
    "Network Transfer" : 5
    "Management Overhead" : 3
```

#### Primary Cost Drivers (What's Eating Your Budget)

1. **GPU Compute: 60-70% of total costs** 🎯 *Biggest optimization opportunity*
   - **GPU type**: Newer GPUs (H100) cost more but are more efficient
   - **Utilization**: Idle GPUs still cost money - aim for 70-80% utilization
   - **Pricing model**: Spot instances can be 60-70% cheaper than on-demand
   
   *💡 Quick win: Switch to spot instances for non-critical workloads*

2. **Model Storage: 10-20% of total costs**
   - **Model files**: Large models (70B parameters) = ~140GB storage
   - **Multiple copies**: Dev, staging, prod, and version history
   - **Fast access**: SSD storage costs more but improves load times
   
   *💡 Quick win: Use lifecycle policies to archive old model versions*

3. **Memory and CPU: 8-15% of total costs**
   - **RAM**: LLMs need lots of memory to hold model weights
   - **CPU overhead**: For request preprocessing and response formatting
   - **Network**: Moving data between storage and compute
   
   *💡 Quick win: Right-size memory allocations - don't over-provision*

### Cost Modeling Framework

- **Memory optimization analysis** including model weights, KV cache, and system overhead
- **ROI analysis and forecasting** with detailed cost breakdowns
- **Real-time pricing updates** and market analysis capabilities

**Core Calculations:**
- Memory requirements (model weights + KV cache + activations + overhead)
- GPU count optimization for both throughput and memory constraints
- Cost per request analysis across different deployment configurations
- Storage and network cost estimation with realistic usage patterns

**Quick Usage:**
```python
from llm_cost_calculator import LLMCostCalculator

calculator = LLMCostCalculator()
gpu_req = calculator.calculate_gpu_requirements("llama-3.1-8b", target_rps=10)
comparison = calculator.compare_providers("llama-3.1-8b", 10)
```

### Model Quantization: Your Biggest Cost Saver

**What is quantization?** Think of it like image compression for AI models. Just as JPEG compression makes photos smaller with minimal quality loss, quantization makes models smaller with minimal performance loss.

**The magic**: Reduce memory usage by 50-75% = reduce costs by 50-75%!

#### Quantization Explained Simply

- **FP16 (Half Precision)**: Default format, uses 16 bits per number
- **INT8 (8-bit Integer)**: Uses 8 bits per number = 50% smaller = 50% cheaper
- **INT4 (4-bit Integer)**: Uses 4 bits per number = 75% smaller = 75% cheaper

**Example**: A 70B parameter model
- **FP16**: ~140GB memory, costs $8,000/month
- **INT8**: ~70GB memory, costs $4,000/month (50% savings!)
- **INT4**: ~35GB memory, costs $2,000/month (75% savings!)

**Quality impact**: Usually less than 5% performance drop

**Quantization Optimizer Framework:**
- **Multiple quantization strategies**: FP16, INT8, INT4, Mixed Precision, Dynamic
- **Automatic cost-benefit analysis** with performance impact estimation
- **GPU compatibility checking** for different quantization types
- **llm-d configuration generation** with optimized resource requirements
- **Implementation complexity assessment** for planning purposes

**Quantization Profiles:**
- **FP16**: 50% memory reduction, 99.5% performance retention, 40% cost savings
- **INT8**: 75% memory reduction, 97% performance retention, 65% cost savings  
- **INT4**: 87.5% memory reduction, 92% performance retention, 80% cost savings
- **Mixed Precision**: 60% memory reduction, 98.5% performance retention, 50% cost savings

options = optimizer.analyze_quantization_options("llama-3.1-8b", gpu_memory_gb=40)
config = optimizer.generate_quantization_config("llama-3.1-8b", "int8")
```

### Prefill/Decode Disaggregation: llm-d's Secret Weapon

**What is disaggregation?** LLM inference has two distinct phases:
1. **Prefill**: Reading and understanding your prompt (CPU-heavy, can batch well)
2. **Decode**: Generating the response word by word (GPU-heavy, needs low latency)

**The insight**: These phases have different resource needs, so we can optimize them separately!

#### Why This Saves Money

**Traditional approach**: One big expensive server handles both phases
- Wastes money on over-provisioned resources
- GPU sits idle during prefill
- CPU sits idle during decode

**llm-d disaggregation**: Separate fleets optimized for each phase
- **Prefill fleet**: Cheaper servers, bigger batches, spot instances
- **Decode fleet**: Faster servers, smaller batches, consistent performance

**Result**: 30-40% cost reduction with better performance!

## SLO-Driven Scaling with llm-d Inference Scheduler

### Why llm-d's Inference Scheduler is Different

Traditional Kubernetes autoscaling treats all workloads the same. The llm-d inference-scheduler understands LLM-specific patterns:

- **Token generation patterns**: Knows that longer sequences cost more
- **Model characteristics**: Different models have different cost/performance profiles  
- **Queue dynamics**: Understands how batching affects both cost and latency
- **SLO prioritization**: Can trade off between cost, latency, and throughput

### Inference Scheduler Configuration

The llm-d inference-scheduler provides SLO-driven scaling specifically designed for LLM workloads with cost optimization as a first-class concern.

**Cost-Aware SLO Framework:**
- **Weighted Latency**: P95 latency adjusted for request cost impact
- **Cost Efficient Throughput**: Tokens per second per dollar spent optimization
- **GPU Cost Efficiency**: GPU utilization weighted by cost savings potential

**Scaling Policies:**
- Scale up on SLO violations (>5% normal, >15% urgent)
- Scale down when over-performing (>10% margin) 
- Cost-based scaling when cost per request exceeds thresholds
- Spot instance management with graceful fallback strategies

**Advanced Features:**
- Dynamic batching with cost-aware batch sizing
- Request complexity routing to optimize model selection
- Spot interruption handling with cost-aware migration
- Real-time cost monitoring and budget enforcement

:::note Configuration
📁 **[Inference Scheduler Config](./cost-optimization/inference-scheduler-config.yaml)** - Complete SLO-driven scaling configuration with cost optimization
:::

**Quick Setup:**
```yaml
apiVersion: inference.llm-d.io/v1alpha1
kind: LLMDeployment
spec:
  schedulerName: "cost-optimized-scheduler"
  scaling:
    mode: "scheduler_managed"
    constraints:
      maxCostPerHour: 50.0
      maxCostPerRequest: 0.005
```

### Scheduler Integration with LLMDeployments

The scheduler seamlessly integrates with individual LLMDeployment resources to provide cost-aware scaling:

**Integration Features:**
- Automatic detection of cost-optimization annotations
- SLO profile selection (cost-efficient, balanced, performance)
- Spot instance preference management
- Cost and performance constraint enforcement

**Key Annotations:**
- `scheduler.llm-d.io/cost-optimization: "enabled"`
- `scheduler.llm-d.io/slo-profile: "cost-efficient"`
- `cost-optimization.llm-d.io/max-cost-per-hour: "50.0"`

### How It Works: SLO-Driven Cost Optimization

The inference-scheduler continuously monitors and optimizes:

#### 1. Real-time SLO Monitoring
The scheduler continuously evaluates Service Level Objectives:
- **SLO violation detection** with configurable thresholds and urgency levels
- **Weighted scoring system** balancing latency, throughput, and cost objectives
- **Automatic metric collection** from Prometheus and llm-d instrumentation

#### 2. Cost-Aware Scaling Decisions
Intelligent scaling decisions balance performance and cost:
- **SLO-driven scaling** with weighted violation analysis
- **Budget constraint enforcement** preventing cost overruns
- **Performance vs cost trade-offs** with configurable preference weighting

#### 3. Intelligent Request Routing
Complexity-based routing optimizes cost efficiency:
- **Request complexity analysis** using prompt characteristics and expected output
- **Model capability matching** ensuring quality requirements are met
- **Cost-efficiency optimization** selecting the most economical capable model

**Disaggregated Serving Configuration:**

The prefill/decode disaggregation strategy separates inference into specialized fleets:

- **Prefill Fleet**: Optimized for throughput with larger batches and spot instances (85% GPU utilization)
- **Decode Fleet**: Optimized for latency with smaller batches and mixed instance types
- **Intelligent Routing**: Adaptive request routing based on prompt length and generation requirements
- **Separate Autoscaling**: Independent scaling policies for each phase

**Key Benefits:**
- 30% cost reduction vs monolithic serving
- 33% throughput increase
- 25% latency improvement
- 40% GPU utilization improvement

## Your Cost Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1) - Target: 50% savings
✅ **Enable INT8 quantization** - Usually 5% quality impact, 50% cost savings
✅ **Add spot instances** - Start with 50% spot, 40-60% cost savings  
✅ **Enable autoscaling** - Stop paying for idle resources
✅ **Right-size resources** - Don't over-provision memory/CPU

### Phase 2: Smart Optimizations (Month 1) - Target: 70% total savings
✅ **Implement caching** - 30-40% of requests are often cacheable
✅ **Add request batching** - Improves throughput and reduces costs
✅ **Use prefill/decode disaggregation** - llm-d's unique 30-40% savings
✅ **Monitor and tune** - Watch for optimization opportunities

### Phase 3: Advanced Strategies (Month 2-3) - Target: 80%+ total savings
✅ **Deploy llm-d inference-scheduler** - SLO-driven scaling that understands LLM workloads
✅ **Dynamic model routing** - Route simple queries to smaller models
✅ **Cost-aware request prioritization** - Use scheduler's complexity analysis
✅ **Consider hybrid infrastructure** - On-premise for base load if volume justifies
✅ **Implement comprehensive monitoring** - Track cost per request trends

### Common Beginner Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

❌ **"Quantization will hurt quality"** → Start with INT8, test, measure impact
❌ **"We need 99.99% uptime"** → Most workloads are fine with 99.9% and spot instances
❌ **"Bigger is always better"** → Start small, measure, then scale appropriately
❌ **"We'll optimize later"** → Cost optimization is much easier to build in from day 1

## Summary and Next Steps

### What You've Learned

🎯 **LLM costs are different** - But that makes them easier to optimize dramatically
🎯 **Start simple** - Quantization + spot instances = 60-70% savings in hours
🎯 **Build on success** - Layer on disaggregation, routing, and scaling for 80%+ savings
🎯 **Measure everything** - Cost per request is your north star metric

### Your Next Actions (Pick One!)

**If you're just getting started:**
1. Enable INT8 quantization on one model
2. Measure the quality impact (probably less than 5%)
3. Deploy to production and enjoy 50% cost savings

**If you want to go deeper:**
1. Run `make test-costs` to understand your current costs
2. Implement prefill/decode disaggregation with llm-d
3. Set up cost monitoring dashboards

**If you're optimizing at scale:**
1. Use the dynamic routing framework for complexity-based optimization
2. Consider hybrid infrastructure for predictable workloads
3. Implement comprehensive SLO-based scaling

### Tools Provided in This Chapter
