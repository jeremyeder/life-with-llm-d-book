# Progress Checkpoint 1
**Time**: 5-minute mark
**Status**: Research phase complete, beginning Chapter 2 development

## Research Completed:
- ✅ llm-d GitHub organization analysis (6 repositories identified)
- ✅ llm-d-deployer quickstart documentation reviewed
- ✅ Minikube deployment guide analyzed  
- ✅ Main llm-d repository architecture understood
- ✅ Creative Commons style guide reviewed

## Key Findings:
### llm-d Repository Structure:
1. **llm-d-deployer** - Helm charts and deployment automation
2. **llm-d-inference-scheduler** - Go-based inference scheduling
3. **llm-d-kv-cache-manager** - Distributed cache coordination
4. **llm-d-model-service** - Model deployment simplification
5. **llm-d-inference-sim** - vLLM simulator for testing
6. **llm-d** - Main framework repository

### Technical Requirements Identified:
- Kubernetes cluster with GPU support
- Required tools: yq, jq, git, Helm, Kustomize, kubectl
- Hugging Face token for model access
- Storage requirements vary by model size
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring

### Architecture Insights:
- Built on vLLM with Kubernetes-native approach
- Disaggregated serving (separate prefill/decode)
- Distributed KV cache management
- Supports multiple hardware accelerators

## Next Steps:
- Create Chapter 2: Installation and Setup
- Follow progressive complexity (simple → advanced)
- Include both conceptual explanations and full technical examples
- Apply Creative Commons style guidelines
