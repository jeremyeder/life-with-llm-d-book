# Co-Authoring Meeting Facilitation Guide

*30-minute focused session to close major decisions*

---

## Pre-Meeting Preparation (5 minutes)

**Required Reading:**

- Review `CO-AUTHORING-FRAMEWORK.md` one-pager
- Skim the 8 co-authoring rules in `CLAUDE.md`
- Think about which chapters you're most excited to own

**Come Prepared to Decide:**

- Framework adoption (yes/no)
- Your preferred chapter assignments
- How we differentiate from upstream llm-d docs

---

## 30-Minute Meeting Agenda

### **Opening: Framework Demo** (5 minutes)

- **Live demo**: `./validate` script in action
- **Show**: Prompt templates in `/prompts/`
- **Highlight**: < 30 second feedback loop
- **Decision**: Adopt framework? (Default: yes unless objection)

### **Core Decision 1: Value Differentiation** (5 minutes)

**The Strategic Question**: How do we deliver unique value beyond upstream llm-d documentation?

**Options to Consider:**

- 🎯 **Prescriptive Production Configs** - Opinionated, battle-tested setups we actually recommend
- 🖥️ **Interactive Demo Environment** - Live llm-d site readers can experiment with
- 👥 **Multi-Role Integration** - Same technology through data scientist → SRE → platform engineer workflows  
- 🔧 **Production Playbooks** - Real troubleshooting, failure modes, systematic recovery
- 🎬 **Visual/Animated Learning** - Complex concepts explained with animations and interactive demos
- 📋 **Lab Exercise Framework** - Structured hands-on learning path with real environments

**Decision Framework:**

- What's our primary differentiation strategy?
- Which value-adds are feasible given our timeline and resources?
- How does this affect chapter structure and complexity?

### **Core Decision 2: Chapter Ownership** (5 minutes)

**Current Chapter Structure:**

- Chapter 4: Data Scientist workflows and experimentation
- Chapter 5: SRE operations and monitoring  
- Chapter 8: Systematic troubleshooting procedures
- Chapter 10: MLOps and automation workflows
- Additional chapters: [to be mapped]

**Decision Points:**

- Who takes primary ownership of which chapters?
- How do we handle cross-chapter dependencies?
- What's our approach to shared/collaborative chapters?

### **Core Decision 3: Credit Structure** (5 minutes)

**Options:**

- **Equal bylines** - All authors credited equally regardless of contribution
- **Chapter-based attribution** - Primary author credited per chapter with "edited by" others
- **Contribution-based** - Credit proportional to actual work (risky for relationships)
- **Role-based** - Lead author + contributing authors with clear roles

**Questions to Resolve:**

- How do we handle external recognition (talks, interviews, posts)?
- What about unequal contribution scenarios?
- How do we track and validate contributions fairly?

### **Core Decision 4: Quality Bar** (5 minutes)

**Define "Good Enough to Ship":**

- Technical accuracy standards
- Voice consistency requirements  
- Example completeness expectations
- Review and approval process

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- **Perfectionism paralysis** - Endless revisions vs. shipping iteratively
- **Scope creep** - Chapters growing beyond manageable size
- **Cross-reference hell** - Over-optimization of internal links
- **First-draft syndrome** - Publishing rough initial content vs. proper review

### **Core Decision 5: Conflict Resolution** (5 minutes)

**Simple 2-Step Process:**

1. **Direct discussion** - Authors attempt resolution within 24 hours
2. **Binding arbitration** - [Designated person] makes final call within 48 hours

**Common Conflict Scenarios:**

- Technical approach disagreements
- Chapter scope boundary disputes  
- Quality standard interpretations
- Timeline and priority conflicts

## Meeting Success Criteria

### **Must-Have Outcomes:**

- ✅ Framework adoption decision (yes/no)
- ✅ Clear chapter ownership assignments
- ✅ Agreed credit/attribution structure
- ✅ Shared quality bar definition
- ✅ Simple conflict resolution process
- ✅ Primary value differentiation strategy

### **Action Items Template:**

- **Next sync meeting**: [Date/time]
- **Immediate next steps**: [Who does what by when]
- **Chapter assignments**: [Author → Chapters]
- **Framework implementation**: [Timeline for adoption]

---

## Decision-Making Guidelines

### **Default to "Yes"**

- Framework adoption unless specific objection
- Reasonable proposals get adopted quickly
- Bias toward action over analysis

### **Time-Box Discussions**

- 1 minute to state concern
- 1 minute to propose resolution
- Park complex discussions for follow-up

### **Focus on Decisions, Not Process**

- Every topic must end with a clear outcome
- Avoid designing elaborate procedures
- Keep it simple and actionable

---

## Key Reminders

### **This is Strategic, Not Tactical**

We're setting the foundation for successful collaboration, not designing detailed procedures.

### **Relationships Matter Most**  

The best framework is worthless if we damage working relationships. Prioritize amicable resolution.

### **Unique Value is Critical**

If our book isn't clearly better than free upstream docs, it won't succeed. Make sure we're delivering genuine differentiation.
