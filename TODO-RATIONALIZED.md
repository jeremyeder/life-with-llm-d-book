- [ ] Mobile-optimized PWA features for debugging scenarios

**Advanced Content (Future Versions):**
- [ ] Multi-cluster deployment scenarios
- [ ] Edge computing deployment patterns
- [ ] Specialized compliance frameworks (healthcare, finance, government)
- [ ] Advanced threat modeling for LLM infrastructure
- [ ] Community contribution workflows

### Community & Collaboration
**Community Building (Post-Publication):**
- [ ] Link to real Slack/Discord communities for ongoing support
- [ ] Community contribution guidelines

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Current Session)

### Publication Readiness
1. ✅ Fix broken cross-reference links in build
2. ✅ Complete site preview generation
3. ✅ Final consistency validation
4. [ ] Commit all completed content
5. [ ] Tag as major milestone

### Maintenance Mode Items
**Documentation Maintenance:**
- [ ] Dependency updates (Docusaurus 3.5.2 → 3.8.1)
- [ ] Automated security vulnerability scanning setup
- [ ] Quarterly content freshness review process

**Community Handoff:**
- Refer to llm-d.ai contribution webpage for next steps
- Establish maintenance ownership with llm-d project team
- Document update procedures for community contributors

## SCOPE DECISIONS MADE

### Items REMOVED from Original TODO (Scope Reduction)
**Removed - Out of Book Scope:**
- ❌ Jupyter notebook migration guides (too specific)
- ❌ Vendor-specific cloud setup guides (covered generically)
- ❌ Team training curriculum development (out of scope)
- ❌ Business case templates (mentioned, not detailed)

**Removed - Already Covered:**
- ❌ Model registry integration (covered in MLOps chapters)
- ❌ Stakeholder communication templates (mentioned in handoff procedures)
- ❌ Hardware comparison tables (covered in performance chapter)

### Items CONSOLIDATED
**Consolidated into Existing Content:**
- Networking chapter → Merged into Chapter 6 (Performance Optimization)
