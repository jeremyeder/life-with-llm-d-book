## Total Impact
- **Files created**: 14 extracted configuration and script files
- **Total words reduced**: 5,139 words (41.8% overall reduction)
- **Lines of code extracted**: ~3,480 lines
- **Maintained functionality**: 100% - All technical content preserved through file references

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Improved Readability**: Chapters now focus on concepts and explanations rather than large code blocks
2. **Better Maintainability**: Code configurations are in separate, focused files that can be independently updated
3. **Enhanced Usability**: Readers can directly use the extracted files in their deployments
4. **Preserved Completeness**: All technical details maintained through comprehensive file references
5. **Clear Organization**: Related configurations grouped together in logical directory structures
