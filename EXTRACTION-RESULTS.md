- Progressive complexity from basics to advanced

---

## 🔗 Integration Strategy

### In-Book References
Every extracted example replaced with:
```markdown
📎 **Full Example**: [filename.ext](https://github.com/jeremyeder/llm-d-book-examples/tree/main/chapter-XX/directory/filename.ext)
```

### Chapter Footers
Added comprehensive example listings:
```markdown
## Example Code
All examples from this chapter are available in the examples repository:
- [Monitoring Setup](./monitoring/)
- [Alert Configurations](./alerts/)
- [Operational Runbooks](./runbooks/)
```

### Try It Yourself Sections  
Interactive setup instructions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeremyeder/llm-d-book-examples
cd llm-d-book-examples/chapter-05-sre-operations
kubectl apply -f monitoring/
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Move examples to separate repository**: `github.com/jeremyeder/llm-d-book-examples`
2. **Update book chapters**: Add final reference links  
3. **Validation**: Test all extracted examples work independently

### Phase Implementation
- **Phase 1**: Use streamlined book as "llm-d Essentials" (~15k words)
- **Phase 2**: Add production content for "llm-d in Production" 
- **Phase 3**: Advanced topics become "llm-d Advanced & MLOps"
