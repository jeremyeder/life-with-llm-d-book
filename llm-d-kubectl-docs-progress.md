# LLM-D kubectl Documentation Project Progress

## Project Overview
Creating comprehensive kubectl documentation for LLM-D projects targeting Data Scientists and SRE personas, with focus on performance optimization and practical examples.

## Key Project Context
- **Primary Backend**: vLLM (project supports others but vLLM is current focus)
- **Workload Patterns**: Both batch inference and streaming supported
- **CRDs**: Many custom resources exist in LLM-D
- **Model Registry**: S3-based, using OpenDataHub model registry
- **Multi-tenancy**: Standard Kubernetes/OpenShift isolation
- **Networking**: Strong recommendation for RDMA (InfiniBand/RoCE) between worker nodes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack

29. Document Autoscaling patterns: HPA, VPA, and custom metrics scaling ⏳
30. Research storage classes optimized for model storage and NVMe configurations ⏳
31. Document Prometheus integration and metric collection via kubectl ⏳
32. Document OpenShift-specific differences and configurations where applicable ⏳

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Search llm-d-deployer repo for Grafana dashboards and analyze performance panels

### TODO Later (Future Development)
- Disaster Recovery - backup strategies, cross-region replication, failover
- Integration Patterns - service mesh, API gateway, load balancers  
- Tracing with Jaeger integration and distributed tracing setup

### Low Priority
- Create optimized prompt template for kubectl documentation

## Planned Documentation Structure

## Research Notes

### From Competitive Analysis
- Multi-layered documentation approach with progressive complexity
- Strong focus on performance engineering and optimization
- Backend-agnostic design patterns
- Comprehensive troubleshooting matrices
- Clear persona-based organization

### Key Performance Indicators Identified
- GPU utilization and memory usage
- Token throughput (tokens/second)
- Request latency (p50, p90, p99)
- Network bandwidth utilization
- Storage I/O patterns
- Model loading times
- Cost per request/token

## Next Steps Questions
1. Which 3 sections should we prioritize first?
2. Single comprehensive document or multiple focused guides?
3. Start documenting with current knowledge or complete research first?
4. Target audience: internal team or public documentation?
5. Level of detail for YAML manifests and kubectl examples?

## File Structure Considerations
- Separate files per major section
- Markdown format with embedded YAML
- Code examples in separate directories
- Version control for iterative development
